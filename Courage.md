# XP Value - Courage

## Courage in Agile

From the principles in the Agile Manifesto, it is clear that Agile practices foster if not mandate an environment that empowers developers to always strive to achieve a higher quality product in a highly efficient fashion. In order to achieve this, however, it is imperative that the members of an Agile team demonstrate a great deal of courage.
