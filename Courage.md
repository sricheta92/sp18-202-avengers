# XP Value - Courage

## Week 1 

* Courage means being honest about progress and estimates. It means we will adapt to changes when ever they happen. Lack of courage is a hallmark of low-performing teams.

* We agree that each member of the group must be honest and each team member will make the best choices for the project event if discarding failing solutions.

## Week 2

* Major technical issues progresses throughout the week. Each team member continue their technical understanding to apply design pratices and Javascript game engine. 

* One team member decided to use Phase.JS and Vue.JS for the game project.
