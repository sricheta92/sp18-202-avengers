# XP Value - Courage

## Week 1 

* Courage is a mean being honest about progress and estimates. It means we will adapt to changes when ever they happen. Lack of courage is a hallmark of low-performing teams.

* We agree that each member of the group must be honest and each team member will make the best choices for the project event if discarding failing solutions.
