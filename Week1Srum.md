#### Prateek
* What I did yesterday? 
Researched about various game ideas and came up with the following game:-
Nibbles: A worm or snake constantly moves around the board. The player controls the direction the "head" of the worm moves, and the worm must try to eat apples that randomly appear. Eating an apply causes the worm to grow in length. The game ends if the worm crashes into the edge of the board or into itself. 


* What will I do today? 
Discuss about the game ideas other team mates have come up with, and finalize the one we will build. 

* Any roadblacks? 
None, as of now.
