# XP Value - Simplicity

## Week 1

* Simplicity is one of the important core values of XP.  We believe that we should do what is asked for. We will not do less or more. 
Scope is important for us. 
* On Day 2, We discussed a lot of ideas and defining what we need to do was impotant. We incorporated that value successfully.
