# XP Value - Simplicity

## Week 1

* Simplicity is one of the important core values of XP.  We believe that we should do what is asked for. We will not do less or more. 
Scope is important for us. 
* On Day 2, We discussed a lot of ideas and defining what we need to do was impotant. We incorporated that value successfully.


## Week 2

* When we finally decided to build the game on Phaser JS, all the team members wanted to add many cool features in the game. But we thought of the timeline. We decided not to add too much complexity and build it simple and the best.
