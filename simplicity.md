# XP Value - Simplicity

## Week 1

* Simplicity is one of the important core values of XP.  We believe that we should do what is asked for. We will not do less or more. 
Scope is important for us. 
* On Day 2, We discussed a lot of ideas and defining what we need to do was impotant. We incorporated that value successfully.


## Week 2

* When we finally decided to build the game on Phaser JS, all the team members wanted to add many cool features in the game. But we thought of the timeline. We decided not to add too much complexity and build it simple and the best.

## Week 3

*  We deployed the code on heroku. We comleted all the requirement of the hackathon project.
* We started with test harness to make our code unbreakable.

## Week 4 

* The class diagram created this week helped in defining simple modules of the application. This helped in collaborative development. Each team member were assigned different modules which helped in faster development.

## Week 5

* Most of the time in this week was spent on refactoring the integrated code. The seperate modules implemented by each team member were then combined and refactored in a way so that it will be simple to maintain the code for future development. This keeps the application well maintainable.
