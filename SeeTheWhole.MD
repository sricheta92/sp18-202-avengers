# See the whole 

## Week 1
* Whenever there is a choice to optimize a team output or the whole product, we always chose the whole product. 
In many large product development groups, getting everyone to focus on the whole product instead of their individual parts/tasks/specialization is one of the hardest parts of scaling Scrum. Since seeing the whole is all about having the team recognize the big picture, individual contributions play an important role. We made sure that each team member worked extensively on research and development. While doing individual research, each one of us took care of keeping the bigger picture in mind. We have planned to use aglie practices and design patterns. 

## Week 2

* This week, we discussed various ideas and details about the project. Our meetings focused on what would be included in the game, what languages, frameworks, and tools we would use for the project. 

More importantly, we focused on how each choice would effect the long term. We elaborated on our ideas and determined the estimated time and effort it would take to implement each idea. Overall, we did a good job at seeing the whole while putting a magnifying glass on the project.

## Week 3

* To fundamentally implement see the whole, the team must understand at a high level, what tooling revolves around creating the project.We have split the tasks equally, every part of the project is being built considering the overall picture of the game.

## Week 4

* After all the work to explore the various aspects of creating the game, we've finally started creating code. We've learned how important it is to get a better sense of the big picture and scope of the project before starting to implement the little details. The results should be more scalable with less code debt.

## Week 5

* We spent alot of time coding this week. After all of our coding and testing, we've had a mess of a code base with a ton of code debt. Refactoring helps us compile a better list of APIs and abstractions for all the objects required in our program. It gives us all a better sense of how to app will grow in the future.
