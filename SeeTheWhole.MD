# See the whole 

## Week 1
* Whenever there is a choice to optimize a team output or the whole product, we always chose the whole product. 
In many large product development groups, getting everyone to focus on the whole product instead of their individual parts/tasks/specialization is one of the hardest parts of scaling Scrum. Since seeing the whole is all about having the team recognize the big picture, individual contributions play an important role. We made sure that each team member worked extensively on research and development. While doing individual research, each one of us took care of keeping the bigger picture in mind. We have planned to use aglie practices and design patterns. 

## Week 2

* Implemented all five design patterns and we saw the project as a whole.
* Integrated wiith everyone.
